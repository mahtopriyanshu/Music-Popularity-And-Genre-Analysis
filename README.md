# Spotify Song Analysis & Popularity Prediction

![Project Banner]

## üéµ Project Overview

This project analyzes a dataset of over 114,000 songs from Spotify to uncover the key audio features that drive popularity. The analysis includes a full data science workflow: data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), predictive modeling, and unsupervised clustering. The ultimate goal is to understand the "sonic DNA" of a successful song and different music genres.

## üìä Key Findings & Visualizations

### 1. What Makes a Song Popular?
Exploratory analysis revealed that **loudness and energy** are the strongest positive predictors of popularity. In contrast, **acousticness** has a strong negative correlation, suggesting that highly produced, non-acoustic tracks tend to be more popular.

### 2. Predictive Modeling
-   **Popularity Prediction:** A Random Forest Regressor model was built to predict a song's popularity, achieving an **R-squared of 0.53**.
-   **Genre Classification:** A Random Forest Classifier successfully categorized songs into their genres with **74% accuracy** based only on audio features.



### 4. Song Clusters
K-Means clustering identified 5 distinct groups of songs based on their sound, revealing natural groupings that exist beyond traditional genre labels.
